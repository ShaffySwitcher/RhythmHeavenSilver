# Notice

**I will not work on this project anymore**, I don't know if anyone will continue/continued it...
I am just finalizing what I feel like I should of did years ago...<br>

The only thing I am willing to contribute to this after that are bug fixes, so please do not ask for support about this, I will not answer, and go instead ask more people and/or fork it on your own.<br>

*Also, please take note that the release b13 and state of the old source code might be broken.*

This repository is dedicated to host the Rhythm Tengoku English unofficial fan translation, **Rhythm Heaven Silver**.

Rhythm Heaven Silver is a project started in 2008 aiming to translate Rhythm Tengoku in English, for everyone to enjoy.

# Installation
You will need:
* A legally obtained ROM of Rhythm Tengoku **(Rev 0)** (CRC32: `349D7025`)
* An IPS patcher (like this one: https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/)

And you just patch your ROM!

# Contribution
Fork it the project, and either decide to go your own way, or do a pull request.<br>

However there are things that have been decided on this project and you should follow this guideline if you are planning to open a pull request:<br>
* All known mini-games that have come back on Rhythm Heaven Megamix, should use their Megamix names.
* *ポリリズム* should be named *Polyrhythm* despite it's similarities to Built to Scale.

# Build

## Windows
1. Open a command prompt.
2. Download the Rhythm Heaven Silver repository.
	```batch
	git clone https://github.com/ShaffySwitcher/RhythmHeavenSilver
	cd RhythmHeavenSilver
	```
	or you could also just download the source [here](https://github.com/ShaffySwitcher/RhythmHeavenSilver/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
3. Figure out the instructions... (Sorry. It's been a while.)
4. Compile.
	```batch
	compile.bat
	```
## Linux / Mac OS
I have not found Linux / Mac OS alternatives for the tools used, and I don't want to rewrite some of the tools because it will simply be too overcomplicated for a simple translation, so I can only advise to use Wine (although this is untested).

# To-do

* Fix all the little inaccuracy everywhere in the script.
* Also weirdly the patch uses the Rev 0 ROM. Why? Was the Rev 1 not out yet? 
* SFX...

# Credits
There's too many people I'd like to thanks, too much I can't really list, but it should be noted that I am not the original creator of this patch, so please do not credit me for it, all credit should go to the original Rhythm Heaven Silver team.<br>

If you *really* want to get credited for work done on this please just contact me and we'll get sorted this out.

# Contact
**As I am not working on this anymore, please do NOT ask me for help on translating, graphics or anything...**<br> 
However, if you have something to tell/ask otherwise, feel free to add me on Discord (Shaffy#3991).<br>

As I am not in contact with anyone who's working on this, I can't really redirect anyone else for support; however you can probably ask help on the Rhythm Heaven Modding Server, or the Rhythm Tengoku Modding Server.
