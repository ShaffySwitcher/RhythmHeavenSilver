# Rhythm Heaven Silver

![Rhythm Heaven Silver](media/rhs.png?raw=true "Rhythm Heaven Silver")

This repository is dedicated to host the Rhythm Tengoku English unofficial fan translation, **Rhythm Heaven Silver**.

Rhythm Heaven Silver is a project started in 2008 aiming to translate Rhythm Tengoku in English, for everyone to enjoy.

# Installation
You will need:
* A legally obtained ROM of Rhythm Tengoku **(Rev 0)** (CRC32: `349D7025`)
* An IPS patcher (like this one: https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/)

And you just patch your ROM!

# Contribution
Fork it the project, and either decide to go your own way, or do a pull request.<br>
I am right now in need of GFX artists...<br>

However there are things that have been decided on this project and you should follow this guideline if you are planning to open a pull request:<br>
* All known mini-games that have come back on Rhythm Heaven Megamix, should use their Megamix names.
* *ポリリズム* should be named *Polyrhythm* despite its similarities to Built to Scale.

# Build

## Windows
You'll need [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/) to compile the text using abcde.

1. Open a command prompt.
2. Download the Rhythm Heaven Silver repository.
	```batch
	git clone https://github.com/ShaffySwitcher/RhythmHeavenSilver
	cd RhythmHeavenSilver
	```
	or you could also just download the source [here](https://github.com/ShaffySwitcher/RhythmHeavenSilver/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
4. Compile.
	```batch
	compile.bat
	```
## Linux / Mac OS
I have not found Linux / Mac OS alternatives for the tools used, and I don't want to rewrite some of the tools because it will simply be too overcomplicated for a simple translation, so I can only advise to use Wine (although this is untested).

# To-do
Check the issues.

# Credits
There's too many people I'd like to thanks, too much I can't really list, but it should be noted that I am not the original creator of this patch, so please do not credit me for it, all credit should go to the original Rhythm Heaven Silver team.<br>

Even though, thanks Nintendo for releasing this good game that wouldn't of made the Rhythm Heaven franchise real without it.<br>
Thanks to the original creator of this translation patch, including the original translator who made the first script back in 2007...

## Disclamer
I know this patch was either unfinished a decade ago or of questionable quality nowadays. There was a lot of inconsistensy (Megamix / Silver names, Polyrhythm / Built to Scale, etc...) everywhere and known issue.

This is due to the fact that I work (_mostly_) alone since 2019 (atleast when I still worked on it, oh and did I tell you guys I am not an native english speaker?), there is no real quality check, and 3 years ago I wasn't really mature enough for my own quality check. 
So please do not call this hack "garbage" or whatever another word you can find because there's a lot of work behind it.

This is about to change, I am now working with a team of people that submits graphics and new translated text so that hack will
have a new apparence soon and you will be able to experience Rhythm Heaven Silver (or Advance) a new way.

# Contact
If you have something to tell/ask otherwise or if you wanna contribute, feel free to add me on Discord (Shaffy#3991).<br>

As I am not in contact with anyone who's working on this, I can't really redirect anyone else for support; however you can probably ask help on the Rhythm Heaven Modding Server, or the Rhythm Tengoku Modding Server for more technically questions.
