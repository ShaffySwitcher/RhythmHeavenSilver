Name of game, "Marcher". The graphic's the same as Marcher 1, so you can just reuse those sprites.

While it's technically "Marcher 2", Karate Man 2, Vegita-Pull 2 and Night Walk 2 use the old sprites and won't have a 2 in their title cards so it's probably best to keep with that trend rather than try to change all the games at great difficulty.
