intro 2 - name of game, "Trio on Tour". Note the style is the same as Clappy Trio in Stage 1, so the same kinds of letters can be used.

tile 2 - the board in the background is identical to the one used in Clappy Trio, so you can copy the text from that game. Note that the 3 and 4 in the background text can be exchanged for when a fourth character is used in remixes. The three japanese characters in small font say "You" to indicate the player. This can also be copied from the first Clappy Trio game.
