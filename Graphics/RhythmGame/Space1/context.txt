intro 2 - name of game, "Space Dance". Note that the letters appear in individual blocks, and one character is reused. This title may be changed significantly to work with the English name.

Tile2 - text in a bubble reads "You" (to indicate the player)
Other text is overlaid on a bubble, and reads "Turn right" or "Right", "Go down/Drop" (like a dance move), and "Punch". The bubble is different sizes for each piece of text.
The big letter text that says "PUNCH", "RIGHT" and "DROP" in English is not used in the game.
